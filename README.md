# 🛝 Vector Search Playground

**Vector Search Playground** is an experimental space for implementing and benchmarking various vector search algorithms. The long-term goal is to evolve this into a (non production-ready) library for fast and scalable similarity search.

## 🥅 Goals

- Explore different algorithmic approaches to vector similarity search
- Benchmark performance at scale
- Experiment with hardware acceleration (SIMD, GPU)

## 🧭 Roadmap

### 🧬 Algorithms
- Naive brute-force search (Binary heap)
- Inverted File Indexing (IVF)
- KD-Tree
- Product Quantization (PQ)
- Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)

### 📈 Performance
- Scale benchmarking
- SIMD acceleration
- GPU implementation

### ➕ Other
- Multi query search
- Expand supported distance metrics
